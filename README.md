# hotdogWebsite
My first HTML page, made when I was in grade 10 (2018-ish). 
Since then, was looking forward to creating a better website using CSS and JavaScript. 

My newest HTML project, "friends2020" can be found in my repositories.
It was created with a partner who was looking forward to creating a project as well.
